{"changed":true,"filter":false,"title":"README.md","tooltip":"/README.md","value":"# Veera's Vietnam Tours\n\nThis is a website made for the 1st Milestone Project of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.  It represents a website for a fictional travel agency providing tours in Vietnam. \nThe main purpose is to give possible clients information on the tours on offer and a means to contact the company.\n\n## Demo\n\nHere is the [Live Demo](https://vahola.github.io/VietnamTour/16d.html)\n![static Demo] (https://github.com/VAhola/VietnamTour/blob/master/Documents/Layout/Devices.PNG\")\n\n## UX\nThe website is aimed at people who have already decided on Vietnam as their travel destination but are looking for organized tours to see multiple locations within the country.\n\nColor scheme chosen is a combination of gray, white and pink with yellow used as a highlighter to draw attention to certain promotions and bottons.\nThe more neutral basic color scheme was chosen to calm the overall look of the site as most pictures used are very colorful.\n\n\n### User Stories:\n\n1. As a user, I want to see what travel options a company offers so that I can decide whether to book a trip or not. \n1. As a user, I want to be able to book my trip via the website\n1. As a user, I want to be able to find the contact details so that I can easily contact the company.\n1. As a user, I want to be able to locate the social media presence easily \n\n### Design documents \n\nDesign documents are located [here] (/Documents/Wireframes)\n\n## Features\n\n\n\n### Existing Features\n\nThe site uses a collapsed navigation bar for small screens and a while for larger screens it stays fully visible.\n\nThe footer is sticky, placed at the bottom of the page for more balanced look accross different screen sizes.\n\nThere are links to the various social media accounts in the footer; for the purpose of the project my personal accounts were linked there.\n\nAs the navigation bar is not sticky but disappars when scrolling down the page a link back to top is included in the footer.\n\nThere are also three bottons on the site:\n\n- Book an 8 day tour\n        - Visitor can book an 8 day tour, by filling out the submit form in section \"Our Tours\" page \"8 Day Vietnam at a glance\" with their email address\n- Book a 16 day tour \n        - Visitor can book a 16 day tour, by filling out the submit form in section \"Our Tours\" page \"16 Day Complete Vietnam at a glance\" with their email address\n- Subscribe to a newsletter\n        - Visitors can subscribe to a newsletter, by clicking on Sign Up! button and filling out the submit form in home page.\n\n### Features Left to Implement\n\nShould this be used for an actual travel agency the following features would need to be added to make sure visitors can fully complete their booking process via site:\n- Calendar based booking system allowing user to finalize the initial reservation immediately\n- Enable payment during the booking process\n- A user login, including possibilities to:\n    - View booked trips\n    - Manage bookings\n    - Share booking details with other registered users\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n-\tBootstrapcdn\n    -\tBootstrap for modifiable design elements\n    -   Font-awesome for adding icons\n- HTML\n- CSS\n\n## Testing\n\nThe follow tests were made to ensure the sign up and book buttons and forms are working properly:\n1.
