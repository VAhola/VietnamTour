This allows for varied climate within the country, from the tropical heath of the south to cool winters of the north. The varied landscapes perfectly reflect this difference, providing for an interesting destination for all travellers.</p>","            <p>The capital city Hanoi is located in the Northern part of Vietnam and offers a large variety of activities and things to see, ranging from bike tours to cooking classes. For history lovers there are multitude of musea covering the fascinating history of the country and the city itself.</p>","            <p>Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city of Vietnam. Located in the south, it maintains a tropical weather through out the year. Like Hanoi, Ho Chi Mihn City hosts a great variety of cultural sites and activities. Food lovers will also be spoiled in this City famous for its pork rolls and Pho.</p>","            <p>To balance out the hectic city life, Vietnam also offeres a great variety of coastal towns, beaches and islands. Combined with fresh food and friendly locals these make for a relaxing escape from reality.</p>","         </div>","      </div>","      <div class=\"dest\">","         <h2>Getting ready for your trip</h2>","      </div>","      <div class=\"dest\">","         <p>Before you start your trip to Vietnam there are a couple of things to consider in order to enjoy safe stay in the country:</p>","         <img src=\"Assets/pictures/art-camera-journey-970203.jpg\" style=\"float: left\" class=\"info_left\"  alt=\"picture of journey planning\">","         <h6>Visa</h6>","         <p>Depending on the country you are coming from and the lenght of your stay in Vietnam you might need to arrange a Tourist Visa. Before applying for a Visa it is advisable to check whether you actually need one for your stay or not.  https://vietnamvisa.govt.vn/requirements/ has a good up-to-date listing on the requirements per country. If you do need a Visa, it is advisable to apply online prior to your journey. This is relatively cheap and will make entry to the country easier on arrival.</p>","         <h6>Currency</h6>","         <p>The currency of VIetnam is VND, which as of July 2019 translates as 1/26,217 against EUR and 1/23,240 against USD. It is possible to exchange major currencies all over Vietnam, so if you are coming from EUR or USD zones you will not need to exchange funds in advance. Airports will have multiple options for currency exchange upon arrival.</p>","         <img src=\"Assets/pictures/medical-sister-1780696_1920.jpg\" style=\"float: right\" class=\"info_right\"  alt=\"medical sister\">","         <h6>Vaccinations</h6>","         <p>Next to the regular vaccinations recommended for travellers (such as Tetanus and Mumbs) it is also good to get cover for Typhoid and Hepatitis A. Similarly, vaccinations against Rabies and Hepatitis B are worth considering -especially for travellers visiting the more rural parts or the country or statying longer term. It is also good to keep in mind that the vaccinations should be taken in advance, generally no later than a month before you planned travel date.</p>","         <h6>Malaria</h6>","         <p>The risk of obtaining Malaria in Vietnam is relatively high so travellers are also advised to consider anti-malaria medication.

south. This allows for varied climate within the country, from the tropical heath of the south to cool winters of the north. The varied landscapes perfectly reflect this difference, providing for an interesting destination for all travellers.</p>","               <p>The capital city Hanoi is located in the Northern part of Vietnam and offers a large variety of activities and things to see, ranging from bike tours to cooking classes. For history lovers there are multitude of musea covering the fascinating history of the country and the city itself.</p>","               <p>Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city of Vietnam. Located in the south, it maintains a tropical weather through out the year. Like Hanoi, Ho Chi Mihn City hosts a great variety of cultural sites and activities. Food lovers will also be spoiled in this City famous for its pork rolls and Pho.</p>","               <p>To balance out the hectic city life, Vietnam also offeres a great variety of coastal towns, beaches and islands. Combined with fresh food and friendly locals these make for a relaxing escape from reality.</p>","            </div>","         </div>","         <div class=\"dest\">","            <h2>Getting ready for your trip</h2>","         </div>","         <div class=\"dest\">","            <p>Before you start your trip to Vietnam there are a couple of things to consider in order to enjoy safe stay in the country:</p>","            <img src=\"Assets/pictures/art-camera-journey-970203.jpg\" style=\"float: left\" class=\"info_left\"  alt=\"picture of journey planning\">","            <h6>Visa</h6>","            <p>Depending on the country you are coming from and the lenght of your stay in Vietnam you might need to arrange a Tourist Visa. Before applying for a Visa it is advisable to check whether you actually need one for your stay or not.  https://vietnamvisa.govt.vn/requirements/ has a good up-to-date listing on the requirements per country. If you do need a Visa, it is advisable to apply online prior to your journey. This is relatively cheap and will make entry to the country easier on arrival.</p>","            <h6>Currency</h6>","            <p>The currency of VIetnam is VND, which as of July 2019 translates as 1/26,217 against EUR and 1/23,240 against USD.

Similarly, vaccinations against Rabies and Hepatitis B are worth considering -especially for travellers visiting the more rural parts or the country or statying longer term.
