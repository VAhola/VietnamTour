# Veera's Vietnam Tours

This is a website made for the 1st Milestone Project of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.  It represents a website for a fictional travel agency providing tours in Vietnam. 
The main purpose is to give possible clients information on the tours on offer and a means to contact the company.

## Demo


## UX
The website is aimed at people who have already decided on Vietnam as their travel destination but are looking for organized tours to see multiple locations within the country.

Color scheme chosen is a combination of gray, white and pink with yellow used as a highlighter to draw attention to certain promotions and bottons.
The more neutral basic color scheme was chosen to calm the overall look of the site as most pictures used are very colorful.




### User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to see what travel options a company offers so that I can decide whether to book a trip or not. 
2. As a user, I want to be able to find the contact details so that I can easily contact the company.

## Features



### Existing Features

The site uses a collapsed navigation bar for small screens and a while for larger screens it stays fully visible.

The footer is sticky, placed at the bottom of the page for more balanced look accross different screen sizes.

There are links to the various social media accounts in the footer; for the purpose of the project my personal accounts were linked there.

As the navigation bar is not sticky but disappars when scrolling down the page a link back to top is included in the footer.

There are also three bottons on the site:

- Book an 8 day tour
        - Visitor can book an 8 day tour, by filling out the submit form in section "Our Tours" page "8 Day Vietnam at a glance" with their email address
- Book a 16 day tour 
        - Visitor can book a 16 day tour, by filling out the submit form in section "Our Tours" page "16 Day Complete Vietnam at a glance" with their email address
- Subscribe to a newsletter
        - Visitors can subscribe to a newsletter, by clicking on Sign Up! button and filling out the submit form in home page.

### Features Left to Implement

Should this be used for an actual travel agency the following features would need to be added to make sure visitors can fully complete their booking process via site:
- Calendar based booking system allowing user to finalize the initial reservation immediately
- Enable payment during the booking process
- A user login, including possibilities to:
    - View booked trips
    - Manage bookings
    - Share booking details with other registered users
