Veera's Vietnam Tours

This is a website made for the 1st Milestone Project of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.  It represents a website for a fictional travel agency providing tours in Vietnam. 
The main purpose is to give possible clients information on the tours on offer and a means to contact the company.

UX
The website is aimed at people who have already decided on Vietnam as their travel destination but are looking for organized tours to see multiple locations within the country.

User Stories:
•	As a user, I want to see what travel options a company offers so that I can decide whether to book a trip or not. 
•	As a user, I want to be able to find the contact details so that I can easily contact the company.
•	Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
