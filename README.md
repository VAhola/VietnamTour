# Veera's Vietnam Tours

This is a website made for the 1st Milestone Project of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.  It represents a website for a fictional travel agency providing tours in Vietnam. 
The main purpose is to give possible clients information on the tours on offer and a means to contact the company.

## UX
The website is aimed at people who have already decided on Vietnam as their travel destination but are looking for organized tours to see multiple locations within the country.

### User Stories:
1. As a user, I want to see what travel options a company offers so that I can decide whether to book a trip or not. 
2. As a user, I want to be able to find the contact details so that I can easily contact the company.
